# üõ†Ô∏è SCC Risk Visualization App

This project visualizes and analyzes pipeline data related to **Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)** using `Stationing` and various pipeline parameters like soil resistivity, PSP voltage, hoop stress, and more.

---

## üìä Features

- Visualize graphs for:
  - Soil Resistivity vs Stationing
  - OFF PSP vs Stationing (with threshold lines at 0.85V and 1.2V)
  - Hoop Stress (% of SMYS) vs Stationing (with 60% threshold)
  - Pipe Age, Temperature, Remaining Thickness, etc.
- Highlights data points above risk thresholds.
- Designed to integrate with **Streamlit** for web-based apps.

## üöÄ How to Run the Graph Script

### Option 1: Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Paste and run the content from `scc_graphs.py`.
3. It will load the Excel file from GitHub and generate graphs.

### Option 2: Local Python Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepakmahawar150620-beep/SCC_Pawan.git
cd SCC_Pawan
pip install pandas openpyxl plotly
python scc_graphs.py
